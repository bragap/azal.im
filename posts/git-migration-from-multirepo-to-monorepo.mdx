You may have found yourself in a situation where you have multiple git
repositories for different components of your project, and now you decided to
switch to a monorepo approach.

# Merging repositories while maintaining history

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to merge multiple repositories into one
monorepo, while maintaining the commit history of each repository:

Let's assume you have three repositories:

- A backend repository, called "back"
- A frontend repository, called "front"
- A freshly created repository, called "monorepo"

1. Clone the monorepo repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/org-name/monorepo.git monorepo
```

1. Install git-filter-repo

We will use [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) for manipulating the
commit history of the repositories, which is a tool endorsed by the official Git documentation.

On MacOS, you can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install git-filter-repo
```

2. Clone the repositories that you want to merge into the monorepo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/org-name/back.git back
git clone https://github.com/org-name/front.git front
```

These are throwaway clones that you are going to modify, so you should delete them later
to make sure you don't accidentally push changes to the original repositories.

3. Move the codebase of each original repository into a subdirectory

For this example, I want to have each repository in a separate subdirectory
of the monorepo. To do this, I will use the `--to-subdirectory-filter` option
of git-filter-repo to move while preserving the commit history.

```bash
cd back
git filter-repo --force --to-subdirectory-filter back

cd ../front
git filter-repo --force --to-subdirectory-filter front
```

4. **Optional:** Append a prefix to the commit messages of each repository

```bash
cd ../back
git filter-repo --force --to-subdirectory-filter back --message-callback 'return b"back: " + message'

cd ../front
git filter-repo --force --to-subdirectory-filter front --message-callback 'return b"front: " + message'
```

4. Add the repositories as remotes to the monorepo repository

Now, you can add the repositories as remotes to the monorepo repository.

```bash
cd ../monorepo
git remote add -f back ../back
git remote add -f front ../front
```

5. Merge the repositories into the monorepo

We will use `git merge` to merge the repositories into the monorepo. This will
create a merge commit that will include the commit history of the original repositories.

```bash
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories -m "Merging backend repository into the monorepo" back/main
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories -m "Merging frontend repository into the monorepo" front/main
```

6. Push the changes to the monorepo repository

Finally, you can push the changes to the monorepo repository.

```bash
git push origin main
```

That's it! You have successfully merged multiple repositories into one monorepo.
