                    It was an honor to volunteer for the WebTech extension project for one year. I was responsible for
                    developing the project's website and contributed to other initiatives as well.

                    Along with my team, I developed a web application that allowed Boutique das Carnes to manage its
                    operation, including inventory management and order processing.
